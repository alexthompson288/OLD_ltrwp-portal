                            Of course as parents we all know how to read and you're doing it right now without thinking.  But how do we teach it?  We believe that the strongest readers are those who are exposed to letters, words and stories at home as well as in the classroom.</p>


                            <p>These articles aim to clarify (and demystify!) the most important processes and skills a child must master to become a fluent reader so they can give them the best chance of mastering and enjoying reading from home.  These include phonics (phonemes and graphemes), blending (reading), segmenting (spelling), keywords, cvc words, rhyming, alternative spelling and alternative pronunciation. </p>

                    <p>
                        Systematic synthetic phonics is an approach to teaching children how to read and write.It provides young learners with a simple and clear introduction to the idea of a <strong>correspondence between written symbols and certain sounds</strong>.  For example, systematic synthetic phonics allows a child to see the word 'cat' written down, recognize the letter symbols 'c', 'a', 't', apply the appropriate sounds to the letter symbols and 'blend' them together to say the word 'cat'.</p>

                        <p>Conversely, synthetic phonics allows a child to hear the word 'cat', decode it into its constituent sounds 'c', 'a', 't', and write down the letter symbols that represent those sounds, thus spelling.  We use memory aides to help children remember the correspondance between letters and their sounds.</p>  

                        <p>You can download a copy of our memory aides <a href="assets/website_mnemonics.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Other approaches towards teaching literacy do exist such as analytic phonics, where words are broken down into their beginning and end sounds like “str” and 'eet' to read street, or whole word approach, where words are recognized and learnt by heart.</p>

                        <p>However, systematic synthetic phonics provides young learners with strategies to decode words, which is especially important because English is such a difficult language to learn with the many different ways to make the same sounds from different letters or combinations of letters.</p>

                        <p>Children who learn using synthetic phonics become more independent readers and are able to have a go at new words working from sound alone, whereas those using analytic phonics are more dependent on having prior knowledge of families of words.

                            <p>A phoneme is basically a sound.  It is the smallest distinct unit of sound and multiple sounds (or phonemes) are blended together to make up words and there are 44 of them in the English language.</p>
                            <p>the word 'cat' contains three distinct sounds 'c', 'a' and 't'.  However, the word 'fear' contains just two distinct phonemes (or sounds): 'f' and 'ear'.</p>
                            <p>This all seems simple enough.  Phonemes are sounds that are mapped to letters when they are written down.  If only it was all that simple!</p>
                            <p>English is not a totally phonetic language and many sounds can be spelt using different letter combinations and the same letter combinations can make different sounds.  Think of the sentence 'the soldier wound the bandage around his wound'!
                            <p>You can find a great website which demonstrates the letter-sound (grapheme-phoneme) correspondance <a href="http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/activities/phonemic-chart" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>If phonemes are sounds, then graphemes are letters.  Phonics is all about understanding and practising the correspondance between letters and sounds.  Some sounds are made by single letters (which are single letter graphemes), like the 'a' in 'angry ant'.  However, some sounds (phonemes) are represented in written text by a combination of more than one letter, like the 'th' in 'three thumbs' or the 'air' in 'hairy fairy'. When a grapheme consists of two letters it is called a digraph (like 'ea' in 'sea'.  When it has three letters it is a trigraph (like the 'tch' in 'watch').  You can find a great website which demonstrates the letter-sound (grapheme-phoneme) correspondance <a href="http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/activities/phonemic-chart" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Blending is one of the skills children need to develop when learning to read with phonics. A child needs to be able to look at the letter symbols (or graphemes) in a word, hear the sounds (or phonemes) those letter symbols represent, blend those sounds together and hear the whole word that those sounds build.</p>
                        
                        <p>A simple example would be the word 'dog'.  The skill of blending allows the child to recognize the three graphemes that make up the word 'dog' and match those letter symbols with their approriate sound.  The child then says out loud the sounds 'd', 'o', 'g' and blends them together to create the word 'dog'.  This system allows the child to see the word 'dog' on a page and associate it with the concept of a dog which they already know.</p>
                        
                        <p>A similar yet slightly more complex example would be the word 'book'.  The only difference is that 'oo' in book is a single sound made up of two letter symbols (digraph).  The child has to learn that 'book' is blended with 'b', 'oo', 'k'.</p>
                        
                        <p>Blending needs practice – some children grasp the skill straight away and others can take much longer. The two main reasons why children struggle to hear the word when they have said the sounds are that they don’t know the letter sounds well enough (so they pause to think between letters) which makes it hard to recognize the whole word or the letter sounds are not being pronounced correctly.

                    <p>
                        Segmenting is basically spelling.  It is the prcoess by which a child is able to hear a word spoken, decode (or break down) that given word into its constituent unique sounds (or phonemes), match those phonemes with the relevant letter symbols (or graphemes) that represent those sounds and write down those letter symbols in the right order.</p>
                        
                        <p>For example, if a child hears the word 'Pip' and is asked to spell that word, the process of segmenting that word will involve the child decoding word into the following sounds 'p', 'i', 'p'.  The child then has to have the ability to recall the correspondance between the sound 'p' (as in 'pretty pony') and the symbol 'p', then 'i', then 'p' again. </p>

                        <p>Segmenting, or spelling, becomes more complex when single sounds are made up of multiple letters, for example 'cook' ('oo'), or 'cake'(the 'e' is linked with the 'a' in a split digraph).  Or when a word has a sound that can be represented by a number of different letter symbols, like 'EXAMPLE NEEDED'.</p>

                        <p>In essence, reading or blending and spelling (or segmenting) are all about a deep familiarity with the relationships that exist between letter symbols and their respective sounds.  This is learned through regular concentrated practise and consolidation over time combined with real life application of the new things learned.</p>

                        <p>
                            We know about the correspondence between letter symbols and their sounds.  The words which follow these rules, like 'bug' or 'sunset' are called phonetic words.  </p>

                        <p>There are, however, in the English language a number of words which cannot be read using a phonics approach because they do not follow these rules.  These words are known as <strong>'tricky words', 'sight words' or 'keywords'</strong>.  In our program we call them 'Very Important Words'.  These words are some of the most common in our wonderful language but, because they do not follow the rules, they must be learnt by heart as whole words. </p>
                        <p>Examples of 'Very Important Words' are 'the', 'one', 'two' and 'she'.  It is critical that the child understands that these words are different to normal words, otherwise he or she may be confused as to why he or she isn't able to blend or segment them using the phonics rules they have already learnt.</p>
                            
                        <p>The best way to learn these is regular practise, practise and then a bit more practise! </p>

                    <p>A child starts by learning to read and spell simple words by using blending and segmenting to find the corrrespondance between the sounds in a word and their written symbols.  For example, a child recognizes the letters 'l', 'o', 'g' in the word log, knows the sounds each of those symbols makes and blends them together to read the word 'log'.</p> 
                    
                    <p>This is a fantastic start, but obviously most English words are more complex than words like 'dog', 'cat' and 'log'.  We call these words CVC, which stands for consonant, vowel, consonant words.  We start with CVC words to help the child learn and practise the correspondance between sounds and their written symbols.</p>  

                    <p>Once a child has made progress on that front, it is important to start reading and spelling more complex words.  The next stage is CCVC and CVCC words, like 'stop' or 'barn'.  Whilst the sophistication of word has slightly increased, the principles of blending and segmenting the sounds and letter symbols remains exactly the same.
                    Once a child moves onto CCCVC etc. words, the child is now in a position to deal with any level of complexity including words with two or more syllables.

                        <h5>Alliteration</h5>
                    <p>
                        This is the repetition and stressing of a particular sound to help a young learner tune their ear and identify the particular sound in question. For example, the memory aide 'magical monkey' uses alliteration to emphasise and isolate the 'm' sound.  
                    </p>

                   
                        <h5>Oral Blending</h5>
                    <p>
                        Oral blending is an important first step in learning to fully blend and being able to read text from a page or screen.  With oral-blending the young learner is provided the individual phonemes (sounds) that make up the word and needs to blend those sounds together to make the whole word.      
                    </p>

                    
                        <h5>Rhyming</h5>

                    <h5>Alternative pronunciation and spelling</h5>
                    <p>
                        As we know, the very heart of a phonics-based approach to learning to read is the correspondence between sounds (phonemes) and their letter symbols (graphemes).  In its most basic format the sound 'd' is represented by the symbol 'd', 'f' by 'f', 'm' by 'm' and so on.  </p>

                        <p>However, like all brilliant things, the English language is not quite as simple as that.  Many sounds can be represented by different letter symbols and many letter symbols can make multiple sounds!  This makes the English language so wonderfully diverse and subtle, but it also makes it very hard for both children learning to read and spell, and for foreigners learning English as a second language.</p>

                        <p>A single sound being represented by multiple letter symbols is called alternative spelling.  An example of this would be 'deer' and 'dear' or 'gym' and 'Jim'.  Learners must become familiar with these different written forms representing the same sound.</p>

                        <p>A single letter and group of letters (grapheme) having multiple possible sounds is called alternative pronunciation.  An example of this is 'wound' and 'wound', 'desert' and 'desert'.</p>
